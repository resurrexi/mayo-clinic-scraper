# Mayo Clinic Scraper

Web scraper that scrapes the diseases and conditions of [Mayo Clinic]http://www.mayoclinic.org).

The scraper will dump the following information about all the diseases/conditions in a SQLite DB:

* Diseases/Conditions and their links (Done)
* Definition/Overview (TODO)
* Symptoms (TODO)
* Causes (TODO)
* Risk Factors (TODO)

## Why did I build this scraper?

* To enhance a model that I'm building at work that will generate questions for nurses to ask patients when they have a certain condition.
* Do some topic modeling with the texts that I'm scraping and doing some topic similarities with descriptions in ICD diagnosis codes
* ...and some other ideas that I might come up with once I start drilling down into the whole data... maybe do some natural language generation with all the text... who knows..

## Enhancements

* Build an API to return relevant information

## License

Um... whatever license that says "Free to use and modify"
